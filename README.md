# Frailty and Survival Regression Models in Stan

This is a replication of the code from Nathaniel Forde's PyMC tutorial on Frailty and Survival Regression Models, which can be found [here](https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/survival_analysis/frailty_models.html). Rather than specifying the models in PyMC, this repository replicates all the models using CmdStanPy. It also nicely demonstrates how to integrate arviz into your CmdStanPy model interrogations. Also, if you're like me and are unable to find comphrensive use of arviz with CmdStanPy, then going through this should get you an intuitive feel for how to replicate the results you usually gets with PyMC's built in coordinate and dimension specification.
